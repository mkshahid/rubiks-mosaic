# Rubiks-Cube-Mosaic
Rubik's cube single-face solver coded in Python. This code is intended to be used to create a Rubik's cube mosaic. The user can enter the desired output, and the steps to achieve that output will be printed.
Solver adapted from <a href="https://github.com/CubeLuke">Lucas</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TomBrannan">Tom Brannan</a> to solve given a desired output for one face of the cube.

To run the Solver, run the cube.py file. The GUI will automatically start up. If you get errors, there is a chance that you do not have tkinter installed. That is necessary to have in order to run the GUI.

### Features
Just read the instructions to see some of the features that are included in the Solver.
Various features included are:  
* The ability to enter desired output
* User or program generated scrambles  
* The ability to make custom moves  
* The ability to hit either the solve button, or each step of the solve to see it solve step-by-step  
* The ability to run simulations with a user defined amount of solves (be careful, too many could make the program freeze)  
* Ability to copy scrambles or solutions to the clipboard, as well as view externally.  
* Clicking on the 2D cube will allow you to see the other bottom tiles that are not normally visible
